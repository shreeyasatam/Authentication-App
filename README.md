# Authentication-App
Created login/registration page which allows user to register and login
Utilized the Mongoose framework to connect Node.js to the MongoDB database.
Used GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE operations to carry out CRUPD operations.
Created login and registration pages; the first time a person registers, they enter their email and click the "Submit" button. The ability to store user input in a database has been added.
Authentication capability has been added; to access one's own account in a web app, a user must provide the same username and password each time.
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, NodeJS, expressjs, Mongoose, and MongoDB are among the technologies used.
